## Global Happiness: 
### A Look into How Different Countries Rank Their Happiness and What Contributes to Those Scores

Happiness is a species wide phenomenon that can be highly subjective, based on cultural constructs all the way down to personal beliefs; at its core, however, happiness may be more predictable. In what is becoming an annual tradition, the United Nations releases their World Happiness Report in an attempt to raise global awareness of happiness and its possible influences. The data comes from the Gallup World Poll, where participants are asked to rate their overall happiness from 0, being the worst they could imagine feeling, to 10, being the happiest they can imagine. They are then asked to rate six different characteristics that they feel contribute to their chosen happiness score. Those characteristics include: economy (GDP per capita), social/family support, overall health and life expectancy, freedom of choice, trust in their government or perceptions of governmental corruption, and the generosity they experience. 

I gathered the data published for the years 2015 to 2019 and formed a few base questions to kick start my explorations: what are the top five happiest countries by year? What are the top five unhappiest countries by year? Using the given data, are there any specific indicators of a country's overall happiness score? From these questions I then hypothesized that all six characteristics would show at least a slight positive correlation with the happiness score, with the highest positive correlation seen between social support and happiness score as well as health and happiness score, and the lowest positive correlation seen between generosity and happiness score.

## Correlations With the Six Categories

For each given year, from 2015-2019, there appears to be a strong positive correlation between the happiness score and a country's economy or GDP per capita; we can also see strong positive correlations between the happiness score and the social or family support available, as well as between the happiness score and a country's overall health and life expectancy, the second and third following my own hypotheses while the former showed more correlation than what was expected. We can see slight positive correlations between happiness score and both perceptions of freedom and government trust, as hypothesized. Lastly, when comparing the happiness score with a country's generosity, it appears to have little to no correlation at all; this went against my hypothesis that there would be a small positive correlation between the two.Â 

## Conclusion

From this data we can conclude that at a global level the three most important factors contributing to overall happiness scores is that given country's economy or GDP per capita, the level in which individuals feel they receive social or family support, and that given country's overall health and life expectancy. This becomes even more apparent as we compare the happiness scores of the top ten happiest countries with the top ten countries in each of the six categories.
