title: An Aspiring Data Scientist
subtitle: My computer science journey
---

My name is Daniel Benson, born to Michelle Inouye and Charlie Benson on June 23, 1988. I lived a life of many passions, constantly changing to find the 'right one'. I wanted to go to space. I wanted to become an explorer and blaze a trail through the Bermuda Triangle. I wanted to be a professional basketball player, a nurse, a doctor, a psychologist, a neuroscientist. I picked up book after book, delving deep into the depths of each of these professions. I learned what I could of so many topics, but always came up short of my ultimate goal. Learning. Knowing. They were but past times to a mind that hungered for an outlet; so much being taken in with so little coming out. Then, like the final piece of a puzzle fitting perfectly into place, the image became clear. I began the journey of the self-taught computer scientist, once again picking up books and blazing trails through the internet all while finally putting my teachings to use. My path eventually lead me to Lambda, where I am currently undergoing training to become a Data Scientist.

Some interesting tidbits and accolades:

- I have an educational background in Biology and Psychology
- I obtained my Associate Degree of Science in 2017
- I have two cats, one of which is tri-pedal: his nickname is tripod
